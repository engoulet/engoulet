### About Me:

Several of the large projects I have taken part in can be found here! Some small personal projects I have done can be found 
in the "Personal Projects" repository (repo), while the repos for other projects I have completed can either be found on my profile, 
or are linked below (for repos that I am a contributor for, but do not own).
